    "The goal of this practical course is to decode information from an non-invasive cerebral signal : Electroencephalogram (EEG). To this aim, we are going to implement a classification task using a model based on the GPT (Generative Pre-Trained Tranformers) architecture. This model has been Pretrained on a large amount of EEG data. Our goal today is to finetune this model to use it as an EEG classifier. "
